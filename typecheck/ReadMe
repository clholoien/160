Compilers Project 4 Type Check
Carson Holoien

This project was the hardest one so far this quarter.  The most difficult part
was the scoping.  Understanding where exactly I needed to declare procedures and
variables was also difficult.  The given default_rule(p) made the view children
 very easy to implement.  I tested this extensively, and am confident my code
 will pass everything.

There are comments in the code that describe everything, with checking each and
every type used in conditional statements, expressions, procedure declarations
and variables.
